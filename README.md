# House Price Prediction – End-to-End ML Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project implements a production ready, end-to-end machine learning system to predict residential house prices using real-world housing data.
It covers the complete ML lifecycle, starting from data preprocessing, feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment and serves real-time predictions through a publicly accessible Streamlit web application.
ion.

The model is trained on the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset (Kaggle) and uses a tuned XGBoost Regressor wrapped inside a robust sklearn Pipeline.

## Problem Statement

Accurate house price estimation is critical for buyers, sellers, and real-estate investors. However, real-world housing data presents several challenges:

- High-dimensional and high-cardinality categorical features
- Missing and noisy real-world data
- Maintaining feature consistency between training and deployment

This project addresses these challenges using a production grade preprocessing and modeling pipeline designed for reliable inference in a deployed environment.

## Solution Architecture
The system follows a production-style machine learning pipeline:

1. Raw Housing Data
2. Outlier removal applied during training only
3. Feature preprocessing using sklearn ColumnTransformer:
   - One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
   - Numeric feature pass-through
4. Price prediction using a tuned XGBoost Regressor
5. Real-time inference via Streamlit web application deployed using Docker and Render

#### Key Design Principles

- All preprocessing and modeling steps are encapsulated inside a single sklearn Pipeline.
- Identical transformations are applied during training and inference.
- The deployed system is fully containerized using Docker, ensuring environment consistency.

#### Encoding Strategy
Although the original coursework explored target encoding for high-cardinality features, the deployed production pipeline uses One-Hot Encoding for categorical features to ensure:
- Leakage free inference
- Robust handling of unseen categories
- Simpler and more reliable deployment

## Model Details

- **Model:** XGBoost Regressor
- **Hyperparameters:**
n_estimators = 100, max_depth = 3, learning_rate = 0.1, subsample = 0.8

#### Feature Handling
- 36 Numerical Features
- 40 Nominal Categorical Features → One-Hot Encoding

Evaluation Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
